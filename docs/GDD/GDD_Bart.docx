## **Game Design Document: Bart vs. The Shinning**

---

### **Gameplay Mechanics**

#### **Movement**
- **Walk:** Bart moves at a standard pace, suitable for precise platforming.
- **Run:** Bart moves at a slightly faster pace. Useful for dodging enemies or covering distances quickly.
- **Jump:** Bart can leap to reach higher platforms or evade obstacles.
- **Skateboarding:**  
  - When Bart picks up his skateboard, his speed increases significantly.
  - Skateboarding allows Bart to break certain obstacles or cover long distances faster, but it reduces his control slightly.  
  - Stamina drains while using the skateboard, and it requires donuts to recharge.

#### **Item Collection**
Bart can collect and use various tools to assist him in his journey:

1. **Tools:**  
   - **Flashlight:** Lights up dark areas, allowing Bart to see hidden platforms and enemies.  
     - Requires batteries to function.  
   - **Slingshot:** Bart’s primary weapon for attacking enemies.  
     - Ammunition: Marbles scattered throughout the levels.  
   - **Skateboard:** Found in specific levels or as a collectible. Allows Bart to move faster and perform special tricks.  

2. **Consumables:**  
   - **Donuts:** Restore Bart's stamina and grant bonus points.  
   - **Batteries:** Recharge the flashlight's power.  
   - **Marbles:** Used as ammo for the slingshot.

2. **Exploration:**  
   - Players navigate the level, collecting items like batteries, marbles, donuts, and tools.
   - Certain areas require the flashlight to illuminate dark spaces.  
   - The skateboard can be used for speed challenges or to escape chasing enemies.
